Premium Magento is a PHP based eCommerce platform that is packaged as an advanced, highly-reliable, and auto-scalable cluster on top of certified Jelastic stack templates with the following topology and peculiarities:
- **Premium CDN** - integration with the [Edgecast CDN](https://jelastic.com/blog/enterprise-cdn-verizon-integration/) network provides a lightning-fast user experience and ensures higher search engines rank with advanced caching and acceleration strategies, massive bandwidth capacity, [HTTP/3](https://docs.jelastic.com/http3/) support
- [**Let's Encrypt SSL**](https://jelastic.com/blog/free-ssl-certificates-with-lets-encrypt/) the add-on provides automation for all the SSL certificate management operations - trusted certificate issuing, custom domain validation, automatic certificate renewal
- [**LiteSpeed Web ADC**](https://docs.jelastic.com/litespeed-web-adc/) advanced load balancer with flexible traffic distribution algorithm (to optimize performance), modern HTTP/3 protocol support, and ESI dynamic cache (to serve dynamic requests directly reducing the number of requests to backend servers) 
- [**LiteSpeed Web Server**](https://docs.jelastic.com/litespeed-web-server/) a high-performance web server with a wide feature set, such as HTTP/3 support, ESI cache, CSS and JavaScript optimization, image optimization, browser and object cache support, CDN support, built-in WAF, Geo-DNS, CAPTCHA, IP throttling, cutting-edge anti-DDoS protection, etc.
- [**Web Application Firewall**](https://www.litespeedtech.com/support/wiki/doku.php/litespeed_wiki:waf) (WAF) a security feature for the LiteSpeed Web Server stacks that comes with Layer-7 Anti-DDoS Filtering, IP level bandwidth, and request rate throttling
- [**LiteMage Cache**](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/cache-plugins/magento-acceleration) enhanced caching solution for dynamic assets that allows storing them as static ones to significantly speed up the requests serving
- **MariaDB Cluster** the primary-primary replication topology offers better performance for storing dynamic content and a simpler failover procedure
- **Redis** a high-performance RAM-allocated caching solution that is running inside the LiteSpeed Web Server container to store already loaded database query results and serve them up faster per request
- [**OpenSearch**](https://opensearch.org/) a community-driven, open-source search engine (based on the Jelastic OpenSearch certified template) that provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search
- [**Data Storage**](https://docs.jelastic.com/data-storage-container) node for media files
